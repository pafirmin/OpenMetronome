# Open Metronome: a work in progress

The aim is to create a free and functional programmable metronome, as such a thing is hard to come by on the web. Primarily, users must be able to create routines to alternate between time signatures/tempos.

## To do

- Implement triplet pulse
- Clean up UI
- Have pendulum animation reliably sync with metronome pulse -- perhaps a canvas element?

## Done

### 22/3/2021

- Pendulum animation. Weee!
- Adjustable tempo and metre

### 23/3/2021

- Achieved consistent pulse with Web Audio API
- Basic programming functionality
