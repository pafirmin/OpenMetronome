#Open Metronome
My aim is to create a free and functional programmable metronome, as such a thing is hard to come by on the web. Primarily, users must be able to create routines to alternate between time signatures/tempos. Utilises the web audio API for consistent timing.

#To do
- Implement 8th note/16th note/triplet pulse
- Clean up UI
- Have pendulum animation reliably sync with metronome pulse -- may require canvas element?
